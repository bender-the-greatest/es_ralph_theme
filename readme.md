Based off of the Pixel theme by Eric Hettervik.

This is just a simple theme I made for my son on his RG350, and probably isn't fully fleshed out for anything other than the simple views. However, this does work great for EmulationStation on an RG350 or similar retro handheld.

Installation
============
Copy the `ralph` folder to your `~/.emulationstation/themes` directory and you should be able to select `ralph` from the UI theme settings in EmulationStation.
