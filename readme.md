# EmulationStation Theme 'ralph' v1.0 - 04-15-2020 by Bender, the Greatest

Based off of the Pixel theme by Eric Hettervik.

This is just a simple theme I made for my son on his RG350, and probably isn't fully fleshed out for anything other than the simple views. However, this does work great for EmulationStation on an RG350 or similar retro handheld.
